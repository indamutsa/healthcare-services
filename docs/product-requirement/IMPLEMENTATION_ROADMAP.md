**Goal**: Create folder structure and baseline utilities

#### Tasks
- [ ] Create folder structure
  ```bash
  scripts/
  ├── common/
  ├── infrastructure/
  ├── data-ingestion/
  ├── storage/
  ├── processing-layer/

- [ ] Dependency mappings (LAYER_DEPENDENCIES)
- [ ] Service-to-layer mappings
- [ ] Helper functions (get_layer_services, get_layer_dependencies)

**Extracted from original script**: Lines 976-986, 1008-1018 (validation logic)

#### Testing Strategy
```bash
# Test logging
source common/utils.sh
log_info "Test message"
log_error "Test error"

# Test Docker operations
check_service_running "minio"
