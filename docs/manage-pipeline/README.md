## üöÄ Quick Start (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Update docker-compose.yml

Add profiles to mlflow-server, ml-training, and model-serving:

```yaml
mlflow-server:
  # ... existing config ...
  profiles:
    - ml-pipeline    # üëà ADD THIS
```

### Step 2: Set up the script

```bash
chmod +x manage_pipeline.sh
```

### Step 3: Test it

```bash
# Start infrastructure
./manage_pipeline.sh --start-level 0

# Verify MLflow is NOT running (should show ‚úó)
./manage_pipeline.sh --status

# Start ML Pipeline
./manage_pipeline.sh --start-level 4

# Verify MLflow IS running now (should show ‚úì)
./manage_pipeline.sh --status

# Access MLflow
open http://localhost:5000
```

---

## üéØ Key Changes from Old System

### OLD: MLflow in Level 0
```bash
./manage_pipeline.sh --start-level 0
# ‚ùå MLflow starts immediately (wasteful)
```

### NEW: MLflow in Level 4
```bash
./manage_pipeline.sh --start-level 0
# ‚úÖ Only infrastructure starts

./manage_pipeline.sh --start-level 4
# ‚úÖ MLflow starts with ML training and serving
```

### Benefits:
- **Resource efficiency**: Don't run MLflow unnecessarily
- **Logical grouping**: ML tools together with ML pipeline
- **Better separation**: Infrastructure vs ML concerns
- **Cleaner management**: Start only what you need

## üìä Level Overview

| Level | Name | Key Services | When to Use |
|-------|------|--------------|-------------|
| **0** | Infrastructure | MinIO, Postgres, Redis, Kafka | Always - base layer |
| **1** | Data Ingestion | Kafka Producer/Consumer | Testing data flow |
| **2** | Data Processing | Spark Streaming/Batch | Processing pipelines |
| **3** | Feature Engineering | Feature service | ML feature work |
| **4** | ML Pipeline | **MLflow**, Training, Serving | Model training/serving |
| **5** | Observability | Airflow, Prometheus, Grafana | Monitoring/orchestration |

---

## üî® Most Common Commands

```bash
# Start infrastructure
./manage_pipeline.sh --start-level 0

# Start everything
./manage_pipeline.sh --start-full

# Check status
./manage_pipeline.sh --status

# View logs
./manage_pipeline.sh --logs 2

# Stop level (keep data)
./manage_pipeline.sh --stop-level 3

# Stop level (remove data)
./manage_pipeline.sh --stop-level-full 3

# Nuclear option (remove everything)
./manage_pipeline.sh --clean-all

# Get help
./manage_pipeline.sh --help
```

## üìñ Documentation Reading Order

**For first-time setup:**
1. Read: **SETUP_CHECKLIST.txt** (follow step-by-step)
2. Reference: **docker-compose-level4-section.yml** (for edits)
3. Verify: Run the checklist tests

**For understanding the system:**
1. Read: **LEVEL_BASED_MANAGEMENT_GUIDE.md** (comprehensive)
2. View: **ARCHITECTURE_DIAGRAM.txt** (visual overview)
3. Bookmark: **QUICK_REFERENCE.txt** (for daily use)

**For daily use:**
- Keep **QUICK_REFERENCE.txt** handy
- Use `./manage_pipeline.sh --help`

## üé® Access Points

Once services are running:

| Service | URL | Level | Credentials |
|---------|-----|-------|-------------|
| MinIO Console | http://localhost:9001 | 0 | minioadmin / minioadmin |
| Kafka UI | http://localhost:8090 | 0 | - |
| Redis Insight | http://localhost:5540 | 0 | - |
| MLflow UI | http://localhost:5000 | **4** | - |
| Spark Master | http://localhost:8080 | 2 | - |

| Airflow | http://localhost:8081 | 5 | admin / admin |
| Prometheus | http://localhost:9090 | 5 | - |
| Grafana | http://localhost:3000 | 5 | admin / admin |
| OpenSearch | http://localhost:5601 | 5 | - |

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### MLflow still starts at Level 0?
**Problem**: MLflow-server doesn't have the profile
**Solution**: Check docker-compose.yml has `profiles: [ml-pipeline]` under mlflow-server

### Services won't start?
**Problem**: Dependencies not running
**Solution**: `./manage_pipeline.sh --status` then start dependencies

### Need to reset everything?
**Problem**: System in bad state
**Solution**: `./manage_pipeline.sh --clean-all` then start fresh

### Out of disk space?
**Problem**: Too many volumes/images
**Solution**: `./manage_pipeline.sh --clean-all` (removes everything)

---

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

You'll know the system is working correctly when:

- ‚úÖ `./manage_pipeline.sh --help` shows usage
- ‚úÖ `./manage_pipeline.sh --start-level 0` starts only infrastructure
- ‚úÖ MLflow is **NOT** running at Level 0
- ‚úÖ `./manage_pipeline.sh --start-level 4` starts MLflow
- ‚úÖ MLflow **IS** running at Level 4
- ‚úÖ `./manage_pipeline.sh --status` shows correct states
- ‚úÖ `./manage_pipeline.sh --clean-all` removes everything
- ‚úÖ Can access all UIs at their respective URLs

---

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Apply the changes**: Follow SETUP_CHECKLIST.txt
2. **Test thoroughly**: Run through all test scenarios
3. **Start building**: Use the pipeline for your ML work
4. **Refer to docs**: Keep QUICK_REFERENCE.txt handy
